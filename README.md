# Streamlit Linear Regression Model Application

## Introduction
This Streamlit application demonstrates a simple linear regression model in action. Designed to be both educational and interactive, it allows users to input their data and see how a linear regression model predicts outcomes based on the input. It's an excellent tool for those looking to understand the basics of linear regression in machine learning.

## Features
- Interactive data input through Streamlit's user-friendly interface.
- Real-time visualisation of the input data and the linear regression model's predictions.
- Explanation of the linear regression process and model performance metrics.

## Technologies
- **Streamlit:** For creating the web application and handling user inputs.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualisation.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For creating and using the linear regression model.
